# sd-card-tests
H2testw results for obscure or uncommon micro SD card brands. Cards are first assessed by FakeFlashTest. Observed average results sourced from final H2testw speeds when attempting to verify detected card capacity and compared to speeds from manual transfers afterward. Some cards are being tested for long-term endurance use and reliability in continuously recording security cameras.

| EAGET | 128GB | V30 <br> UHS-III <br> C10 <br> A1 | 119.2GB raw <br> >30 MB/s write | 119.2GB usable <br> 52 MB/s write <br> 82.9 MB/s read | Temu <br> $4.94 | Yes |

To give it some credit, the packaging claimed a 7 MB/s max write, so there's that. The adapter it came with also had no branding whatsoever and limited genuine SD cards to <18 MB/s write. |
| TFIIOK| 128GB | UHS-I <br> C10 <br> A2 | 119.2GB raw <br> >10 MB/s write | 117.0GB usable <br> 43.2 MB/s write <br> 79.8 MB/s read | Temu <br> $3.64 | Yes | Came with adapter. |

| Eldingu | 64GB | UHS-III <br> C10 | 59.6GB raw <br> >30 MB/s write | 59.4GB usable <br> 25.9 MB/s write <br> 84 MB/s read | AliExpress <br> $1.99 | Short of advertised write speed. |
| MUOUM | 64GB | C10 | 59.6GB raw <br> >10MB/s write | 58.6GB usable <br> 33 MB/s write <br> 81 MB/s read | Temu <br> $3.89 | Yes | Write speed began at 80 MB/s and linearly decreased to 33 MB/s over the course of 15min. |
| Microdrive | 64GB | UHS-III <br> C10 | 59.6GB raw <br> >10MB/s write | 58.2GB usable <br> 42 MB/s write <br> 80 MB/s read | Temu <br> $3.48 | Yes | Came with adapter. |
| Hsthe sea | 64GB | UHS-III <br> C10 | 59.6GB raw <br> >30 MB/s write | 59.4GB usable <br> 25.4 MB/s write <br> 80 MB/s read | AliExpress <br> $1.99 | Short of advertised write speed. |

Maybe poor quality control? Will have to purchase multiple and test each. |
| BYKEJI | 64GB | C10 | 59.6GB raw <br> >10 MB/s write | 58.4GB usable <br> 41 MB/s write <br> 72 MB/s read | Temu <br> $3.39 | Yes |

Came formatted as FAT32 but could only be reformatted as NTFS, otherwise crashes FakeFlashTest and File Explorer. Very sketchy card in terms of reliability. |

Do not purchase or use this card. |
